sfbikeshare
===========

Code and data relating to the Bay Area bike share. As of now I have a KML and geojson data set of the proposed bike share 
stations for the launch of the program.  

I hope to provide this data in other formats as well as other datasets relating to
the Bay Area Bike Share soon. I have made a request through Socrata that the MTA share some of their planning data,
but they're more into publishing meaningless maps.

See: https://data.sfgov.org/nominate for my nomination of bikeshare data.

To do:
Make map of YellowBike Bike share data
